Before we go any further, let’s take a minute to acknowledge the Platonic perfectness of Loots’ name, for a nacho-lovin’ college bro. Looooooooooots, you can imagine his friends bellowing when it’s his turn at beer pong. Atta boy Loots! they exclaim as he sinks a flawlessly executed bounce shot.\r\n\r\nAnyway, moving on. If you, like me, were wondering what those guys were doing at the rally, and specifically what they were doing in that moment, Loots has answers for you. Both he and his buddy are students at University of Central Florida, where the rally was held. They aren’t Trump supporters, but decided to see the phenomenon firsthand anyway after they were offered VIP tickets.

Before we go any further, let’s take a minute to acknowledge the Platonic perfectness of Loots’ name, for a nacho-lovin’ college bro. Looooooooooots, you can imagine his friends bellowing when it’s his turn at beer pong. Atta boy Loots! they exclaim as he sinks a flawlessly executed bounce shot.\r\n\r\nAnyway, moving on. If you, like me, were wondering what those guys were doing at the rally, and specifically what they were doing in that moment, Loots has answers for you. Both he and his buddy are students at University of Central Florida, where the rally was held. They aren’t Trump supporters, but decided to see the phenomenon firsthand anyway after they were offered VIP tickets.

If I forget, I’ll probably feel no better or worse by midday. If I’m getting sick, I’ll suck on a zinc lozenge and pop a couple caps of vitamin C. If I forget those too, well, whatever. I’ll be fine.\r\n\r\nAlso, most days, 30 minutes before I exercise, I’ll take a dosage of Assault, or Craze, or Rampage, or C4, or any number of pre-workout pump-up supplements that jack up my heart rate and turn my life into a 45-minute live-action Mastodon song. (Circa Remission, please, none of their poppy newer stuff.) If I forget my dosage, my workout will be sluggish at best, and a disaster at worst: Ten minutes of situps, a sip of water, a heavy sigh, and I’m out of there. When my dosage is right, though, I’ll have an amazing workout followed by roughly 15 minutes of diarrhea. And on the way home, I’ll throw in at least 20 grams of chocolate whey protein in a colored shaker cup.\r\n\r\nGo to any gym and you’ll see dozens of dudes (and a handful of women) shaking dozens of different-colored shaker cups that hold liquids blue, red, orange, and brown. Depending on their status, they’re either taking a pre-workout, mid-workout, or post-workout supplement (usually protein), typically a powder mixed with water or milk. I started taking these supplements in college. A buddy of mine got me to try MusclePharm’s Assault—the best pre-workout supps are named after felonies, weapons, or deranged states of mind, I’ve found—and since then, I can barely pick up a weight without Mr. Hyde (actual name) or something like it raging in my bloodstream.\r\n\r\nBut pre-workout supplements, in particular, can pose serious, possibly lethal risks. An ingredient in Jack3d (actual name) known as DMAA, or dimethylamylamine—originally developed as a nasal decongestant—has been possibly linked to the death of a U.S. soldier; the DoD has pulled Jack3d from GNC shelves on military bases, and the World Anti-Doping Agency banned it as a dietary supplement for international athletes. And yet, Jack3d and other supps with DMAA in it remain on the shelves of civilian GNCs everywhere, and the wrongful death case against USPLabs, who makes the supplement, has been thrown out of court. The FDA, in turn, has no choice but to voice their concerns in strongly worded letters to the companies making these not-drug drugs.\r\n\r\nWhy? For a more in-depth look, I’d direct you toward a Frontline/NYT documentary released a few weeks ago. But in the broadest terms possible, pharmaceutical drugs (like Viagra) and dietary supplements (like Nite Rider Maximum) are regulated very differently. “Supplements are regulated in a post-market capacity,” FDA spokeswoman Lyndsay Meyer tells me. (Meaning, they’re regulated after they come out, not before.) “But there are things that supplement manufacturers need to do prior to entering the market.” Namely, they must adhere to good manufacturing practices, ensure that the listed ingredients are the actual ingredients, and avoid making medical claims. (A supplement cannot “cure polio,” but can “boost the natural antibodies that fight polio,” or whatever.) But even if those rules are skirted or broken, the FDA hardly has the resources to deal with them, and getting shit products off the market can take months, if not years.\r\n\r\nHow’d we get here? The supplement industry was effectively deregulated with the mid-’90s passage of the lobbyist-driven and way-too-Orwellian-sounding Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act, or DSHEA, which opened the universe of dubious vitamins to shills, frauds, and charlatans. Someone even got to Mel Gibson.\r\n\r\nDSHEA allows supplement manufacturers to market anything with established ingredients (those that had been sold in the U.S. before 1994) without evidence that they are safe or effective. And the FDA has been so gutted of power to regulate this heaving behemoth of a business that the most they can do is send letters and make lists of the bad guys. “A lot of products that are marketed for things like bodybuilding or weight loss are found to be tainted with pharmaceutical ingredients,” says Meyer. “In the bodybuilding products, we will find that they contain steroids. With the weight-loss supplements, we’ll find that they contain things like sibutramine.” (Aka the weight-loss supplement Meridia, which caused a few too many strokes and heart failures and was taken off the market. It lives on now in products made by companies like the legit-sounding MyNicKnaxs, LLC, though that company isn’t faring too well, either.) Regardless, thanks to DSHEA, you can now buy your 2,000 IU of vitamin D and your reup of Cobra Labs pre-workout supp The Curse and your Extenze in the same shopping trip.\r\n\r\nDo these things sound like performance-enhancing drugs? Definitely. And true, many sporting bodies have banned their selective use for athletes. But comparing what Peyton Manning was (possibly) injecting into his body to a bunch of plants smashed into a pill like Growth Factor 9 is like comparing gasoline to apple juice. Human growth hormone and anabolic steroids are pharmaceuticals, and illegal without a prescription. Whereas any product made up of a bunch of leaves that claims to be able to increase your HGH levels based off of non-peer-reviewed studies more than likely cannot, and is stupid; any product that tells you it can boost testosterone with, like, extracts or natural ingredients or other jargon farted out of a Whole Foods aisle also cannot. Some of these things are actively dangerous. Almost all of them are a waste of money.\r\n\r\n“The supplements industry has no interest in your bodybuilding, and has no interest in your health,” says Duffy Gaver, a California-based trainer. (He trained Chris Hemsworth for his role in Thor, so.) “The fitness industry is about 10 percent fitness and 90 percent industry. It is not here to get you in shape; it is here to get money out of your pocket.” How much money? They’re hoping to clear 60 billion by 2021.\r\n\r\nSome of that money will be mine. It’s hard to quantify how much cash I’ve dropped at GNC, but since college, I’ve downed a steady stream of mild-grade stimulants with silly names, chased with protein shakes that cause me to bloat like a porpoise from both within and without. Why? Well, because, at least for me, they “work.” They’re a part of my routine, and they keep me disciplined, and thus help me stay in half-decent shape. I’m a weak human being with low motivation.

Not a surprise upset of Donald Trump in Rubio’s home state of Florida, but instead a far more glorious triumph—on the mega-popular reality show Dancing With the Stars.\r\n\r\nMarco Rubio, as far as we know, has not given any indication that he plans to compete on Dancing With the Stars (the 22nd season of the show begins in a few weeks). But of all the career paths left for the senator, a star turn on one of America’s favorite television programs simply makes the most sense.\r\n\r\nLet’s work backwards. Every day makes it increasingly unlikely that Rubio will become president. In last night’s two primaries, he lost by 27 points in Michigan and 42 points in Mississippi, failing to pick up a single delegate in either state. There is no real argument for Rubio winning the election beyond “it will eventually happen, trust us” and/or “we will just steal it at the convention.” His campaign is strenuously denying that he is contemplating dropping out, but that decision now feels inevitable.\r\n\r\nRubio is also not returning to politics, at least not immediately. He announced last year that he would not be running to retain the Senate seat he currently holds. His term ends early next year, and there is no logical next step for him in public office unless he wants to run for governor of Florida in 2018.\r\n\r\nBut why would he do that? Marco Rubio does not seem to like holding elective office. He is not a lifer, drawn to serving his community and destined to whither away on Capitol Hill to the tears and adoration of his longtime colleagues. The Washington Post story regarding him relinquishing his Senate seat says plainly: “Rubio gives up on Senate: ‘He hates it.’” Somewhere, Rod Smart’s ears tingled softly.\r\n\r\nWhat Marco Rubio seems to like most is money. In the nine years he spent in the Florida House of Representatives, Rubio made hundreds of thousands of dollars per year by taking side jobs with law firms that lobbied the state legislature. According to the Washington Post, Rubio made $414,000 in his final year in state government despite legislative salaries being “about $29,000 a year.”\r\n\r\nRubio also likes to spend money. A New York Times report on his family’s fluctuating finances stated that upon receiving $800,000 to write a book about his life, Rubio purchased an $80,000 speedboat, despite various debts. Further, via the Times:\r\n\r\nBy the end of 2005, the Rubios had completed the purchase of a new home, twice the size of their previous one, for $550,000. The house, among the more expensive in West Miami, stood out from the aging homes nearby: It includes an in-ground pool, a handsome brick driveway, meticulously manicured shrubs and oversize windows.\r\nWhereas politicians get paid like shit, Dancing With the Stars contestants rake in cash. The contract between ABC and Bindi Irwin—daughter of deceased wildlife man Steve, and winner of season 21—was revealed in court proceedings last year. Bindi received $125,000 just for showing up, plus bonuses for advancing in the contest. By making it all the way to the finale she ended up making over $350,000.\r\n\r\nIf to get rich off Dancing With the Stars you have to be good at it, then Rubio would seem to have some strong advantages. He is pretty young and more or less in shape. He was a high school football player, so he’s at least relatively athletic (and former football players have traditionally been formidable Dancing With the Stars contestants). He is married to an ex-Miami Dolphins cheerleader, so he could practice at home. He is an avowed fan of EDM and Nicki Minaj, and has previously defended the “party music” of hometown comrade Pitbull. One figures it wouldn’t be Rubio’s first time on the dancefloor.\r\n\r\nHe could, of course, flutter gracefully back into lobbying, where he would immediately be rewarded with millions of dollars. But in doing so, Rubio would be tacitly admitting that he could never become president. The move from elected office to lobbying is often called the revolving door, but in truth hardly anyone ever walks back out. Rubio might hate politics, but he is clearly ambitious, and obviously wants to become president.\r\n\r\nIf his goal is to fatten his bank account and then—like John McCain and Mitt Romney before him—mount an ultimately successful second bid for the Republican nomination, Rubio can’t completely disappear from the public eye for three years. Dancing With the Stars offers him the chance to quickly make hundreds of thousands of dollars while also winning the hearts of middle America with his fleet feet and charming smile. If America has done anything in this primary season, it’s signal loudly and clearly that we are willing to seriously consider electing a reality television star as president.\r\n\r\nBut in the meantime, Rubio can’t ruin his chances of accruing that goodwill. He can’t drag his candidacy out and become a nuisance to the American public. He can’t attempt a hostile takeover of the nomination at the Republican convention and become a villain. He needs to express his disgust with what Donald Trump is doing to American politics and bow out before he gets associated with a presidential election that may go down as the most embarrassing in this country’s history.\r\n\r\nMarco Rubio can’t help the fact that he will exit the current election cycle a loser, one characterized by his bullying opponent as a feeble lightweight unable to shine when it really matters. But he can enter the next cycle—where, once again, there appears to be no clear Republican frontrunner—as a winner. A winner of Dancing With the Stars, sure, but redemption stories gotta start somewhere."}, "commit"=>"Save Article"}

According to the Washington Post, Rubio made $414,000 in his final year in state government despite legislative salaries being “about $29,000 a year.”\r\n\r\nRubio also likes to spend money. A New York Times report on his family’s fluctuating finances stated that upon receiving $800,000 to write a book about his life, Rubio purchased an $80,000 speedboat, despite various debts. Further, via the Times:\r\n\r\nBy the end of 2005, the Rubios had completed the purchase of a new home, twice the size of their previous one, for $550,000. The house, among the more expensive in West Miami, stood out from the aging homes nearby: It includes an in-ground pool, a handsome brick driveway, meticulously manicured shrubs and oversize windows.\r\nWhereas politicians get paid like shit, Dancing With the Stars contestants rake in cash. The contract between ABC and Bindi Irwin—daughter of deceased wildlife man Steve, and winner of season 21—was revealed in court proceedings last year. Bindi received $125,000 just for showing up, plus bonuses for advancing in the contest. By making it all the way to the finale she ended up making over $350,000.\r\n\r\nIf to get rich off Dancing With the Stars you have to be good at it, then Rubio would seem to have some strong advantages. He is pretty young and more or less in shape. He was a high school football player, so he’s at least relatively athletic (and former football players have traditionally been formidable Dancing With the Stars contestants). He is married to an ex-Miami Dolphins cheerleader, so he could practice at home. He is an avowed fan of EDM and Nicki Minaj, and has previously defended the “party music” of hometown comrade Pitbull. One figures it wouldn’t be Rubio’s first time on the dancefloor.\r\n\r\nHe could, of course, flutter gracefully back into lobbying, where he would immediately be rewarded with millions of dollars. But in doing so, Rubio would be tacitly admitting that he could never become president. The move from elected office to lobbying is often called the revolving door, but in truth hardly anyone ever walks back out. Rubio might hate politics, but he is clearly ambitious, and obviously wants to become president.\r\n\r\nIf his goal is to fatten his bank account and then—like John McCain and Mitt Romney before him—mount an ultimately successful second bid for the Republican nomination, Rubio can’t completely disappear from the public eye for three years. Dancing With the Stars offers him the chance to quickly make hundreds of thousands of dollars while also winning the hearts of middle America with his fleet feet and charming smile. If America has done anything in this primary season, it’s signal loudly and clearly that we are willing to seriously consider electing a reality television star as president.\r\n\r\nBut in the meantime, Rubio can’t ruin his chances of accruing that goodwill. He can’t drag his candidacy out and become a nuisance to the American public. He can’t attempt a hostile takeover of the nomination at the Republican convention and become a villain. He needs to express his disgust with what Donald Trump is doing to American politics and bow out before he gets associated with a presidential election that may go down as the most embarrassing in this country’s history.\r\n\r\nMarco Rubio can’t help the fact that he will exit the current election cycle a loser, one characterized by his bullying opponent as a feeble lightweight unable to shine when it really matters. But he can enter the next cycle—where, once again, there appears to be no clear Republican frontrunner—as a winner. A winner of Dancing With the Stars, sure, but redemption stories gotta start somewhere."], ["created_at", "2016-03-09 21:54:40.098655"], ["updated_at", "2016-03-09 21:54:40.098655"]]
